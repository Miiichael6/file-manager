# Changelog

Notable changes in each Dirwise release (up to 1.5.2 the app was called Finder-Win). Installers are on the [Releases](https://github.com/arcly-studio/dirwise/releases) page.

## Unreleased

- **Repository moved to arcly-studio/dirwise** – the update check uses the new API URL. Versions up to 1.6.0 only accept release pages under the old owner, so they will not notify about this or later releases – update manually from the Releases page, winget or the Store.
- **Publisher Arcly Studio** – shown in the installer, Apps & features and the Store package (identities unchanged).
- **Website moved** to https://arcly-studio.github.io/dirwise/.

## [1.6.0](https://github.com/arcly-studio/dirwise/releases/tag/v1.6.0) – 2026-10-14

- **New name: Dirwise** – the previous name pointed to a third-party product. Installer `Dirwise_<version>_x64-setup.exe`, winget ID `krystof2-ops.Dirwise` (coming soon). Settings and the data folders under `com.krystof2ops.finderwin` are kept; the icon and thumbnail cache moved to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\dirwise` (Store build `dirwise-store`) and is rebuilt on demand.
- **Windows 11 window buttons** – the title bar has a small icon and the name “Dirwise” on the left and the standard Minimize, Maximize / Restore and Close buttons on the right, including **Snap Layouts** when hovering Maximize. The coloured buttons on the left are gone.
- **Sidebar** – headings in normal case; sections Quick access (pinned folders, formerly My Favorites) / This PC (Desktop, Downloads, Documents …, formerly Favorites) / Cloud / Drives (with the Recycle Bin, formerly Locations) / Recent / Tags. New context menu item **Pin to Quick Access**.
- **Icons view** – a selected item highlights the whole tile (icon and name), like in Windows 11.
- **Status bar** – “1 of 52 selected · 120.7 GB free”.
- **New folder icon** – amber, in the style of Windows 11 (instead of the blue one).
- **Blurred transparency (Acrylic) replaces the clear one** – More → Appearance → Transparency: Off / Blurred, with three strengths that are now much more see-through (the new Subtle is the old Strong). Native Windows 11 Acrylic, on Windows 11 22H2 and later with Transparency effects on; on Windows 10 and older Windows 11 transparency isn't offered at all (Acrylic there stutters when dragging the window) and a saved setting is turned off. Text keeps WCAG AA contrast over light, dark and colourful wallpapers thanks to a soft halo under the letters. When the window loses focus it turns solid instead of jumping to the grey fill Windows uses. Also in the command palette (“Transparency: Blurred”).
- **File extensions like File Explorer** – shortcuts (.lnk, .url, .pif) never show an extension, so they read “Cursor”, “Dirwise”; other files follow Windows’ “Hide extensions for known file types” (known type = registered association; AlwaysShowExt respected). More → View → File Extensions: Like Windows / Always / Never (also in the command palette). Applies to all views, Preview, Properties, the Recycle Bin, Recent and dialogs; sorting, filtering and search still use the full name. Rename (F2) keeps a hidden extension; a visible one stays unselected.
- **More → View** – new submenu like in File Explorer with Hidden Files (Ctrl+Shift+. stays) and File Extensions; Appearance now holds only the theme and transparency.
- **Toolbar fits narrow windows** – it never runs off the edge (window 900–1920 px, any sidebar width, 100–150 % scaling): the search field gets narrower, then turns into a search icon that expands on click.
- **Quick Look renamed to Preview** (Space, menu, command palette) – the old name belongs to another vendor.
- **Upgrading from Finder-Win 1.5.x** – the Dirwise installer silently uninstalls the old installation (no second copy side by side) and your settings are kept. Pin the app to the taskbar again.

## [1.5.2](https://github.com/arcly-studio/dirwise/releases/tag/v1.5.2) – 2026-10-11

- **Recycle Bin** in the sidebar (last row under Locations; the icon shows empty / full) – list of deleted items with Original Location, Date Deleted and Size (sortable), **Restore** (button, context menu), **Delete Permanently** (Delete key, with confirmation) and **Empty Recycle Bin** (with confirmation). Restore never overwrites an existing item. Also in the command palette (“Recycle Bin”, “Empty Recycle Bin”). Uses the Windows Shell, not the `$Recycle.Bin` folder.
- **Continue as Administrator** – deleting, moving, copying/pasting, renaming, duplicating and creating folders in protected places (e.g. the root of C:\) now offers “Continue as Administrator” and Windows asks for confirmation (UAC), like File Explorer; the app itself does not run as administrator. Restoring from the Recycle Bin into a protected place works too. Operations done as administrator are not added to Undo.
- **Shift+Delete** deletes permanently (with confirmation).
- **Fixed:** deleting in protected places failed with a bare “Some operations were aborted”.
- **Clearer error messages** – each failed item is named with the reason (permission denied, used by another app, doesn't exist, disk full, read-only …); unknown errors show a general sentence and the technical detail under **Details**.

## [1.5.1](https://github.com/arcly-studio/dirwise/releases/tag/v1.5.1) – 2026-10-11

- **Fixed:** with Transparency on, files scrolled under the top bar and the status bar showed through almost sharp and mixed with the buttons – content no longer shows under the bars; the desktop still shows through.

## [1.5.0](https://github.com/arcly-studio/dirwise/releases/tag/v1.5.0) – 2026-10-11

- **New default look: glass** – title bar, toolbar and tabs sit on one translucent, blurred plate and the list shows through it as you scroll; the status bar, menus, context menus, command palette, tooltips and toasts are glass too, dialogs blur what is behind them. The sidebar reaches under the window buttons, with a soft gradient, grain and a grey selection like macOS Sonoma; blue is kept for selected files. The 1.4.2 look can no longer be switched on.
- **Window transparency** – More → Appearance → **Transparency: On / Off** (default Off) and **Transparency strength: Subtle / Medium / Strong** (default Medium); picking a strength turns transparency on. The whole window is transparent – sidebar, list, top bar (title bar, toolbar, tabs) and status bar, all with the same opacity for the chosen strength – so the desktop and other windows show through the app. Content scrolling under the top bar stays blurred (glass). Also in the command palette.
- **Smoother scrolling** in long lists – hover transitions pause while scrolling.
- **Readability** – text contrast meets WCAG AA over white, green and busy wallpapers at every transparency strength.
- **Fixed:** the app stopped responding after pressing the Alt key on its own (or F10).
- **Fixed:** the colour tag palette in the context menu was too narrow; submenus are wider.

## [1.4.2](https://github.com/arcly-studio/dirwise/releases/tag/v1.4.2) – 2026-10-09

- **Drag out of the app** – drag files and folders from Finder-Win to File Explorer, the desktop, a browser upload, Discord or an e-mail. Copy by default, Shift moves. Drag & drop now works both ways.
- **New button** – **+ New** in the toolbar, like File Explorer: Folder, Text Document and every file type Windows offers in New (Word, Excel, ZIP …); also in the context menu (New ▸) and the command palette.
- **Rounded tabs** – each tab is a rounded chip; the active one is highlighted without blending into the content.
- **Terminals** – More → Terminal lists PowerShell 7 and Windows PowerShell separately; unavailable ones are greyed out. Shift+click Open in Terminal picks any installed terminal.
- **Names like File Explorer** – new items that collide get “(2)”, e.g. “New folder (2)”.

## [1.4.1](https://github.com/arcly-studio/dirwise/releases/tag/v1.4.1) – 2026-10-09

- **Fixed:** drag & drop from File Explorer did not work.

## [1.4.0](https://github.com/arcly-studio/dirwise/releases/tag/v1.4.0) – 2026-10-07

- **Split window** – two independent panels (Ctrl+Shift+D), Tab switches, F5 / F6 copy / move to the other panel, draggable divider with a remembered ratio.
- **Command palette** – Ctrl+K: folders, actions, tags, paths, Ctrl+Enter file search; one command registry drives shortcuts, the More menu, toolbar and palette.
- **Video and PDF thumbnails** – in Icons view and the preview column, plus duration, resolution and page count; cached locally on disk.
- **Terminal choice** – More → Terminal: Automatic, Windows Terminal, PowerShell, Command Prompt.
- **Explorer-style tabs** – tab bar always visible, content-sized tabs, **+** right after the last tab, × on hover.
- **Appearance menu** – Light · Dark · Match System (default, follows Windows live); lower title bar (32 px).
- **Czech installer** – language choice during setup.

## 1.3.0 – 2026-10-07

- **Tabs** – Ctrl+T / Ctrl+W / Ctrl+Tab / Ctrl+1…9, middle-click and *Open in New Tab*; each tab has its own history, view, sorting, selection, columns and search; reorder by dragging, drop files on a tab, restored on start (folder, view and sorting).
- **Windows clipboard** – copy / cut / paste files between Finder-Win, Explorer, Outlook and browsers (CF_HDROP).
- **Drag & drop from Explorer** – drop files from Explorer or the desktop onto a folder, a sidebar item, a tab or empty space.
- **Undo / Redo** – rename, move, copy, new item, delete (from the Recycle Bin) and tags, last 50 operations.
- **winget manifest** and an opt-out update check (one GET to the GitHub API per day, no telemetry).

## [1.2.1](https://github.com/arcly-studio/dirwise/releases/tag/v1.2.1) – 2026-10-04

- **New app icon.**

## [1.2.0](https://github.com/arcly-studio/dirwise/releases/tag/v1.2.0) – 2026-10-02

- **English UI, language switcher, localized dates, sizes and plurals** – the app follows your Windows language (English or Czech) and can be switched in More → Language / Jazyk without a restart.

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/arcly-studio/dirwise/releases/tag/v1.1.0) – 2026-10-01

- **Audit fixes** – selection and navigation logic, safer file operations, security and configuration hardening.
- **Multi-select and keyboard navigation** – Ctrl/Shift selection, arrow keys across all views, Sort, Share and Tags buttons in the toolbar.
- **Collision dialog** – paste and move ask what to do when a file with the same name already exists (replace, keep both, skip).
- **New design with shell icons** – real Windows file icons, Sonoma-style folders, image thumbnails, reworked toolbar, sidebar, views and dialogs, WCAG AA contrast in both themes.
- **Animations and virtualization** – virtualized listings with streamed directory loading, jump-free navigation, micro-interactions, smoother scrolling and `prefers-reduced-motion` support.

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/arcly-studio/dirwise/releases/tag/v1.0.0) – 2026-09-28

- First public release.
